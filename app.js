//All the previous code that was used to be here is shifted to intro.js
// If wanted to execute the content moved to intro module, just execute the following command that is commented
//const intro = require("./intro.js");
const os = require("os");
//Here it doesn't print out any content, as per the action that require function does, as there are no output statements inside the OS module, just it contains some mo0dule exports(i.e, some variables that are exported by the module for usability purpose)
