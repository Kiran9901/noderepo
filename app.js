//All the OS info has been migrated to user info. To know about os, execute the following command
//const aboutOS = require("./osinfo.js");
//All the path demo has been migrated to path.js. To know abpout path demo, execute the following line of code

// console.log(require("fs")); //Just to know about teh contents present in the fs module, which stands for filesync module
// const fs_sync = require("./fs-sync"); //readFileSync returns both the files content that is printed to the console
// const fs_async = require("./fs-async"); //here, readFile doesn't return the result, so there's no way to acces the file contents onto the cglobal scope directly, so undefined is printed on the console
